# 🌟 Machine Learning Model Training and Prediction Web App

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** designed to assist users in performing end-to-end machine learning tasks, including:

- **Model Training**: Select and train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) on uploaded datasets.
- **Model Prediction**: Upload new data and predict outcomes using saved models.
- **Model Evaluation**: View confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
- **Data Drift Detection**: (Optional) Detect if the data distribution has changed compared to historical data.
- **Visualization**: Visual tools like confusion matrix plots to understand model performance better.

✅ In short, this project provides a **complete solution** — from model training ➡️ prediction ➡️ evaluation — inside an easy-to-use web app!
